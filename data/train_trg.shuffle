Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

Painting and Calligraphy Competition of Government Employees to be Held in Celebration of the 5th Anniversary of Hong Kong's Return to China  .
Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 18 This year marks the 5th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and also the promulgation and implementation of China's first edition of "Codes of Behavior for Government Employees ." To celebrate these two happy occasions, a painting and calligraphy competition of government employees on the theme "Government Employees as People's Servants" will be promoted among the government employees in Hong Kong, Macao and the Inland .

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .  
The athletes were warmly welcomed at DeGaulle Airport by Buffet, the French minister for Youth and Sports, Sai Luoyale, the ministerial representative in charge of family and children and the disabled, and other parties .   
The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .
Hong Kong Police Found Online Drug Dealing for the First Time  .
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 21 The Hong Kong Police recently found that some people are using the Internet to sell drugs online  .
The narcotics division of the Hong Kong Police pointed out that it is the first time the Hong Kong Police has found such a case and it deserves serious attention  .
According to the Hong Kong Police, in the past year, they had several cases of Hong Kongers using the Internet to purchase such drugs as Ecstasy with credit cards  .
The drug dealers purchased the drugs in Thailand and then mailed them to the drug users in Hong Kong  .
Lau Yeh, chief of the Drug Investigation Division of the Hong Kong Police, pointed out that the cases found last year mainly involved online mail orders with credit cards  .
The Hong Kong police are now working with the proper disciplinary army units to crack down on this new form of crime  .
At the recent Transnational Organized Crime Conference (TOCC) held in Hong Kong, head of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs pointed out that online drug dealing will be a new challenge for the law enforcement agencies in the future  .
The Security Bureau of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region completed the consultation work on the computer-related crimes last year and will make amendments to the laws so as to combat any computer-related crimes  .
African College Students Appealing not to let Africa Become the Marginalized Area of New Technology  .
Xinhua News Agency, Abidjan, March 21 (Reporter Song Nan) At the 2nd Forum of African High Institutions that opened on the 21st, the participating college studens called upon the African youth to actively take advantage of the hi-tech information and tele-communication systems so as to meet the challenges brought by the economic globalization and not let the African continent become a marginal area in the world of new technology  .

The topic of this year's Forum of African High Institutions is: "New technology, Information and Communication Bring More Opportunities to the Training of the African Talents ."  .
During the 3-day conference, experts from dozens of institutions of higher learning and enterprises in Africa will focus their discussions on topics such as "the Future of Africa and the Challenge of New Technology," "Cultural Diversity and Economic Development," "the Opportunities and Future that E-commerce Brings to Africa ."  .

Indonesia Reiterated its Opposition to Foreign Military Presence  .
Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 22 (Reporter Mai Tangyuan) Foreign Ministry of Indonesia issued a press communique on the 22nd that reiterated its opposition to foreign military presence in this island country  .
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 18 This year marks the 5th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and also the promulgation and implementation of China's first edition of "Codes of Behavior for Government Employees ." To celebrate these two happy occasions, a painting and calligraphy competition of government employees on the theme "Government Employees as People's Servants" will be promoted among the government employees in Hong Kong, Macao and the Inland .

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .
Hong Kong Police Found Online Drug Dealing for the First Time  .
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 21 The Hong Kong Police recently found that some people are using the Internet to sell drugs online  .
The narcotics division of the Hong Kong Police pointed out that it is the first time the Hong Kong Police has found such a case and it deserves serious attention  .
According to the Hong Kong Police, in the past year, they had several cases of Hong Kongers using the Internet to purchase such drugs as Ecstasy with credit cards  .
The drug dealers purchased the drugs in Thailand and then mailed them to the drug users in Hong Kong  .
Lau Yeh, chief of the Drug Investigation Division of the Hong Kong Police, pointed out that the cases found last year mainly involved online mail orders with credit cards  .
The Hong Kong police are now working with the proper disciplinary army units to crack down on this new form of crime  .
At the recent Transnational Organized Crime Conference (TOCC) held in Hong Kong, head of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs pointed out that online drug dealing will be a new challenge for the law enforcement agencies in the future  .
The Security Bureau of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region completed the consultation work on the computer-related crimes last year and will make amendments to the laws so as to combat any computer-related crimes  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .  
The athletes were warmly welcomed at DeGaulle Airport by Buffet, the French minister for Youth and Sports, Sai Luoyale, the ministerial representative in charge of family and children and the disabled, and other parties .   
The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .

ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .

The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."

ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .

The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.

As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .

The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .

Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .

The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .

Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .

He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .  
The athletes were warmly welcomed at DeGaulle Airport by Buffet, the French minister for Youth and Sports, Sai Luoyale, the ministerial representative in charge of family and children and the disabled, and other parties .   
The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 21 The Hong Kong Police recently found that some people are using the Internet to sell drugs online  .

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 22 (Reporter Mai Tangyuan) Foreign Ministry of Indonesia issued a press communique on the 22nd that reiterated its opposition to foreign military presence in this island country  .
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.

FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .  
The athletes were warmly welcomed at DeGaulle Airport by Buffet, the French minister for Youth and Sports, Sai Luoyale, the ministerial representative in charge of family and children and the disabled, and other parties .   
The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 22 (Reporter Mai Tangyuan) Foreign Ministry of Indonesia issued a press communique on the 22nd that reiterated its opposition to foreign military presence in this island country  .
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .

As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.

Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game.

FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .  
The athletes were warmly welcomed at DeGaulle Airport by Buffet, the French minister for Youth and Sports, Sai Luoyale, the ministerial representative in charge of family and children and the disabled, and other parties .   
The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 22 (Reporter Mai Tangyuan) Foreign Ministry of Indonesia issued a press communique on the 22nd that reiterated its opposition to foreign military presence in this island country  .
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.

Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .  
The athletes were warmly welcomed at DeGaulle Airport by Buffet, the French minister for Youth and Sports, Sai Luoyale, the ministerial representative in charge of family and children and the disabled, and other parties .   
The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .  
The athletes were warmly welcomed at DeGaulle Airport by Buffet, the French minister for Youth and Sports, Sai Luoyale, the ministerial representative in charge of family and children and the disabled, and other parties .   
The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 18 This year marks the 5th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and also the promulgation and implementation of China's first edition of "Codes of Behavior for Government Employees ."

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 22 (Reporter Mai Tangyuan) Foreign Ministry of Indonesia issued a press communique on the 22nd that reiterated its opposition to foreign military presence in this island country  .
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 18 This year marks the 5th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and also the promulgation and implementation of China's first edition of "Codes of Behavior for Government Employees ."

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .  
The athletes were warmly welcomed at DeGaulle Airport by Buffet, the French minister for Youth and Sports, Sai Luoyale, the ministerial representative in charge of family and children and the disabled, and other parties .

This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 22 (Reporter Mai Tangyuan) Foreign Ministry of Indonesia issued a press communique on the 22nd that reiterated its opposition to foreign military presence in this island country  .
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 18 This year marks the 5th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and also the promulgation and implementation of China's first edition of "Codes of Behavior for Government Employees ." To celebrate these two happy occasions, a painting and calligraphy competition of government employees on the theme "Government Employees as People's Servants" will be promoted among the government employees in Hong Kong, Macao and the Inland .  
The competition will be sponsored by Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po, Association of Mayors of China and Leisure & Cultural Services Department of Hong Kong .   
Government employees who participate in this competition will recreate and portray the landscape and scenery in various parts of the motherland through Chinese painting and handwritten poems .

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .
Hong Kong Police Found Online Drug Dealing for the First Time  .
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 21 The Hong Kong Police recently found that some people are using the Internet to sell drugs online  .

Indonesia Reiterated its Opposition to Foreign Military Presence  .
Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 22 (Reporter Mai Tangyuan) Foreign Ministry of Indonesia issued a press communique on the 22nd that reiterated its opposition to foreign military presence in this island country  .
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 18 This year marks the 5th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and also the promulgation and implementation of China's first edition of "Codes of Behavior for Government Employees ." To celebrate these two happy occasions, a painting and calligraphy competition of government employees on the theme "Government Employees as People's Servants" will be promoted among the government employees in Hong Kong, Macao and the Inland .

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .
Hong Kong Police Found Online Drug Dealing for the First Time  .
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 21 The Hong Kong Police recently found that some people are using the Internet to sell drugs online  .
The narcotics division of the Hong Kong Police pointed out that it is the first time the Hong Kong Police has found such a case and it deserves serious attention  .

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 22 (Reporter Mai Tangyuan) Foreign Ministry of Indonesia issued a press communique on the 22nd that reiterated its opposition to foreign military presence in this island country  .
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 18 This year marks the 5th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and also the promulgation and implementation of China's first edition of "Codes of Behavior for Government Employees ." To celebrate these two happy occasions, a painting and calligraphy competition of government employees on the theme "Government Employees as People's Servants" will be promoted among the government employees in Hong Kong, Macao and the Inland .

Government employees who participate in this competition will recreate and portray the landscape and scenery in various parts of the motherland through Chinese painting and handwritten poems .

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .
Hong Kong Police Found Online Drug Dealing for the First Time  .
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 21 The Hong Kong Police recently found that some people are using the Internet to sell drugs online  .
The narcotics division of the Hong Kong Police pointed out that it is the first time the Hong Kong Police has found such a case and it deserves serious attention  .

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 22 (Reporter Mai Tangyuan) Foreign Ministry of Indonesia issued a press communique on the 22nd that reiterated its opposition to foreign military presence in this island country  .
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 18 This year marks the 5th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and also the promulgation and implementation of China's first edition of "Codes of Behavior for Government Employees ." To celebrate these two happy occasions, a painting and calligraphy competition of government employees on the theme "Government Employees as People's Servants" will be promoted among the government employees in Hong Kong, Macao and the Inland .

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .
Hong Kong Police Found Online Drug Dealing for the First Time  .
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 21 The Hong Kong Police recently found that some people are using the Internet to sell drugs online  .
The narcotics division of the Hong Kong Police pointed out that it is the first time the Hong Kong Police has found such a case and it deserves serious attention  .

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 22 (Reporter Mai Tangyuan) Foreign Ministry of Indonesia issued a press communique on the 22nd that reiterated its opposition to foreign military presence in this island country  .
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 18 This year marks the 5th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and also the promulgation and implementation of China's first edition of "Codes of Behavior for Government Employees ."

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .
Hong Kong Police Found Online Drug Dealing for the First Time  .
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 21 The Hong Kong Police recently found that some people are using the Internet to sell drugs online  .
The narcotics division of the Hong Kong Police pointed out that it is the first time the Hong Kong Police has found such a case and it deserves serious attention  .

The drug dealers purchased the drugs in Thailand and then mailed them to the drug users in Hong Kong  .
Lau Yeh, chief of the Drug Investigation Division of the Hong Kong Police, pointed out that the cases found last year mainly involved online mail orders with credit cards  .
The Hong Kong police are now working with the proper disciplinary army units to crack down on this new form of crime  .

Indonesia Reiterated its Opposition to Foreign Military Presence  .
Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 22 (Reporter Mai Tangyuan) Foreign Ministry of Indonesia issued a press communique on the 22nd that reiterated its opposition to foreign military presence in this island country  .
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 18 This year marks the 5th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and also the promulgation and implementation of China's first edition of "Codes of Behavior for Government Employees ."

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .
Hong Kong Police Found Online Drug Dealing for the First Time  .
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 21 The Hong Kong Police recently found that some people are using the Internet to sell drugs online  .
The narcotics division of the Hong Kong Police pointed out that it is the first time the Hong Kong Police has found such a case and it deserves serious attention  .
According to the Hong Kong Police, in the past year, they had several cases of Hong Kongers using the Internet to purchase such drugs as Ecstasy with credit cards  .
The drug dealers purchased the drugs in Thailand and then mailed them to the drug users in Hong Kong  .
Lau Yeh, chief of the Drug Investigation Division of the Hong Kong Police, pointed out that the cases found last year mainly involved online mail orders with credit cards  .
The Hong Kong police are now working with the proper disciplinary army units to crack down on this new form of crime  .
At the recent Transnational Organized Crime Conference (TOCC) held in Hong Kong, head of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs pointed out that online drug dealing will be a new challenge for the law enforcement agencies in the future  .
The Security Bureau of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region completed the consultation work on the computer-related crimes last year and will make amendments to the laws so as to combat any computer-related crimes  .

During the 3-day conference, experts from dozens of institutions of higher learning and enterprises in Africa will focus their discussions on topics such as "the Future of Africa and the Challenge of New Technology," "Cultural Diversity and Economic Development," "the Opportunities and Future that E-commerce Brings to Africa ."  .

Indonesia Reiterated its Opposition to Foreign Military Presence  .
Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 22 (Reporter Mai Tangyuan) Foreign Ministry of Indonesia issued a press communique on the 22nd that reiterated its opposition to foreign military presence in this island country  .
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 18 This year marks the 5th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and also the promulgation and implementation of China's first edition of "Codes of Behavior for Government Employees ." To celebrate these two happy occasions, a painting and calligraphy competition of government employees on the theme "Government Employees as People's Servants" will be promoted among the government employees in Hong Kong, Macao and the Inland .

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .
Hong Kong Police Found Online Drug Dealing for the First Time  .
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 21 The Hong Kong Police recently found that some people are using the Internet to sell drugs online  .
The narcotics division of the Hong Kong Police pointed out that it is the first time the Hong Kong Police has found such a case and it deserves serious attention  .
According to the Hong Kong Police, in the past year, they had several cases of Hong Kongers using the Internet to purchase such drugs as Ecstasy with credit cards  .
The drug dealers purchased the drugs in Thailand and then mailed them to the drug users in Hong Kong  .
Lau Yeh, chief of the Drug Investigation Division of the Hong Kong Police, pointed out that the cases found last year mainly involved online mail orders with credit cards  .
The Hong Kong police are now working with the proper disciplinary army units to crack down on this new form of crime  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .
Hong Kong Police Found Online Drug Dealing for the First Time  .
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 21 The Hong Kong Police recently found that some people are using the Internet to sell drugs online  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .

The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .
Hong Kong Police Found Online Drug Dealing for the First Time  .
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 21 The Hong Kong Police recently found that some people are using the Internet to sell drugs online  .
The narcotics division of the Hong Kong Police pointed out that it is the first time the Hong Kong Police has found such a case and it deserves serious attention  .
According to the Hong Kong Police, in the past year, they had several cases of Hong Kongers using the Internet to purchase such drugs as Ecstasy with credit cards  .
The drug dealers purchased the drugs in Thailand and then mailed them to the drug users in Hong Kong  .
Lau Yeh, chief of the Drug Investigation Division of the Hong Kong Police, pointed out that the cases found last year mainly involved online mail orders with credit cards  .
The Hong Kong police are now working with the proper disciplinary army units to crack down on this new form of crime  .
At the recent Transnational Organized Crime Conference (TOCC) held in Hong Kong, head of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs pointed out that online drug dealing will be a new challenge for the law enforcement agencies in the future  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .

The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .

ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .

Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .

He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .

ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .

Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .

The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .

Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .  
The athletes were warmly welcomed at DeGaulle Airport by Buffet, the French minister for Youth and Sports, Sai Luoyale, the ministerial representative in charge of family and children and the disabled, and other parties .   
The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 22 (Reporter Mai Tangyuan) Foreign Ministry of Indonesia issued a press communique on the 22nd that reiterated its opposition to foreign military presence in this island country  .
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .  
The athletes were warmly welcomed at DeGaulle Airport by Buffet, the French minister for Youth and Sports, Sai Luoyale, the ministerial representative in charge of family and children and the disabled, and other parties .   
The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .

FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .  
The athletes were warmly welcomed at DeGaulle Airport by Buffet, the French minister for Youth and Sports, Sai Luoyale, the ministerial representative in charge of family and children and the disabled, and other parties .   
The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.

Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .  
The athletes were warmly welcomed at DeGaulle Airport by Buffet, the French minister for Youth and Sports, Sai Luoyale, the ministerial representative in charge of family and children and the disabled, and other parties .   
The French delegation to the Eighth Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States has won at this sports meet a total of 19 medals, of which the female athletes won 9 medals, including 1 gold medal, and male athletes won 10 medals, including 1 gold medal .  
This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.

Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

Export of High-tech Products in Guangdong in First Two Months This Year Reached 3.76 billion US dollars .
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16 (Reporter Chen Ji) The latest statistics show that from January through February this year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province reached 3.76 billion US dollars, up 34.8% over the same period last year and accounted for 25.5% of the total export in the province .
Export of high-tech products has frequently been in the spotlight, making a significant contribution to the growth of foreign trade in Guangdong .
Last year, the export of high-tech products in Guangdong Province was 22.294 billion US dollars, up 31% over the same period the year before, which in turn was 27.2% above the average export growth of the entire province. The net increase of export of high-tech products was 5.27 billion US dollars, making up for the reduced value of exports as a result of the price drop of the traditional labor-intensive products .
Among the high-tech products exported by Guangdong, computers, telecom products and other similar products have outshone the others with a total export value of 19.14 billion US dollars last year, accounting for 85.9% of the total export value of high-tech products in the entire province .
The main markets for Guangdong's high-tech products are in Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union and Japan .
Last year, exports from the high-tech industrial belt in the Pearl River Delta reached a total value of 21.99 billion US dollars which accounted for 98.7% of the high-tech products exported by the province.  
This year, the leading role played by this sector remains strong .
Currently, more than 95% of components of computers made in the Pearl River Delta are manufactured locally. Except CPU's, the region can provide all the other computer components .
Federation International Football Association To Mete out Severe Punishment for Fraud on the Football Field  
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March. 17 Executive Committee of Federation International Football Association(FIFA) disclosed on the 16th at a meeting held in Switzerland that in this year's World Cup, executive referees will take much tougher measures against those players who try to gain advantages by such means as faking a slip.  
According to foreign newswire, Executive Committee of FIFA has indicated in a press communique that they will fully support referees in their strict enforcement of laws, especially while dealing with those players who cheat the audience.  
Executive Committee of FIFA also announced some reform measures .
Players are now allowed to take off their sports clothing after scoring as a way of celebration provided that this would not affect the normal process of the game. As some players may write some potentially provocative messages on their inner vests, FIFA prescribes that starting from July 1 of this year, players' vests must not have any text. FIFA allows advertisements on the player's sports clothing, but they can only appear on the front of the clothing.

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
French Athletes Participating in Special Winter Olympics Returned to Paris with Honors .
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18 (Reporter Wang Jingcheng) The French athletes who participated in Special Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City in the United States from March 7 to March 16 returned to Paris today .

This is the best accomplishment the French delegation has ever achieved in Winter Olympics .  
Sai Luoyale said at a welcome ceremony that the French athletes, with their extraordinary performance, have changed the way the society perceives them . The French people are very thankful to them for their outstanding contribution in their struggle to change the way people perceive the disabled .  
Minister Buffet indicated in her speech that the French government will continue as always its effort to support athletic activities for people with disabilities .  
Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."  
South Korea Will Pass a Message to North Korea of its Hope to Resume Talks  .
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 19 (Reporter Zhang Li) According to the Korean United Press, the Korean government has already made a request to the Indonesian President Megawati, hoping she would pass a message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's hope of resuming talks at an earliest possible date between South Korea and North Korea and between North Korea and the United States .  
One source from the South Korean government said the contents in the message include the common hope of South Korea, the United States and Japan to solve problems through dialogs and it is hoped that North Korea will adopt a positive attitude .  
It is reported that the Indonesian President Megawati will visit North Korea from March 28 to March 30 and visit South Korea from March 30 to April 1 .  
The South Korean government has already passed this message to Indonesia through diplomatic channels .  
As for the news released in the Japanese newspaper Asahi that Megawati will hand a personal letter from Kim Dae Jung in his own handwriting to Kim Jong-il, the South Korean government denied this .  
ECB Officials Said Economic Recovery in Euro Area will Accelerate within the Year  .
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 20 (Reporter Wang Xingqiao) Dr. Issing, chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), indicated here on the 20th that the euro area economy has come out of its slump, and the recovery will start to accelerate in the course of the year .  
Issing made the above statement at the hearing held at the European Parliament in Brussels .  
He said that the latest statistics show the euro area economy has already slowly recovered at the beginning of the year, and the economic rebound is expected to accelerate within the year  .
The economic growth rate in the euro area this year is expected to reach 2% to 2.5%  .
In Issing's opinion, the economic rebound in the euro area has mainly benefited from an increase of consumption outlay and the current close-to-bottom inventory within the euro area  .
As for the inflation, Issing said, the overall inflation rate in the euro area has shown a trend of dropping and currently there is no sign that price instability will occur in the middle phase of the economic development  .
On the global energy situation, Issing remarked that the recent price hike in the world oil market has caused concerns from the economic policy-makers of various nations and that the effect of the oil price hike upon the long-term trend of the economy is not to be underestimated  .

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry reiterated this position as a direct response to a report in USA Today dated March 20 that the United States intends to send troops to Indonesia to help combat the al Qaeda members who have fled there from Afghanistan  .
The communique said that the US government has never made the above request officially to Indonesia and this can also be confirmed by the subsequent denial of the report by the White House and the US Defense Department  .
The communique reiterated that Indonesia follows an active foreign policy with its own initiatives, that Indonesia has already developed a close and beneficial cooperation with the United States and other nations to jointly fight terrorism, and that the Indonesian government is willing to continue strengthening the cooperation in this aspect  .

African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe . 
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .
In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations  .
He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .  
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .  
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .  
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .  
Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .  
Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11 . However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom . They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .  
At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .  
Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe .

Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday  .
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery . However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this .   
The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up . Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape .  
Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels .  
Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket .  
He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment .  
As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery ."  
Jordan has averaged a score of 24 .3 during this season . He underwent the surgery three weeks ago . In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8 .   
At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season . The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference . It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th .  
Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games .  
Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time .  
Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team ."
